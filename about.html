<p>Hello! My name is Randi, "randideo" is a nickname my grandmother gave me. I grew up in Montana but currently live in the Pacific Northwest with my husband and son.
</p>
<p>This site will be filled with creative projects (comics/art, food, crafts, kid stuff) and things that other people may find helpful.</p>
<p>I believe humanity has a lot of potential and daydream often about our future here on Earth and in the stars. Like most people, my hope is to leave this planet at least a little better than I found it.</p>
