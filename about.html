<p>Hello! My name is Randi, "randideo" is a nickname my grandmother gave me. I grew up in Montana but currently live in the Pacific Northwest with my husband and son.
</p>
<p>This site will be filled with creative projects (comics/art, food, crafts, kid stuff) and things I think other people may find helpful.
</p>
<p>I love humanity and daydream often about our future here on Earth and in space. I also often think about life and how we can make it less painful for everybody. Like most people, my hope is to leave this planet at least a little better than I found it.</p>
