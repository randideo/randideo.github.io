<p>Hello! My name is Randi, "randideo" is a nickname my grandmother gave me. I grew up in Montana but currently live in the Pacific Northwest with my husband and son.

  This site will be filled with creative projects (comics/art, food, crafts, kid stuff) and things that I think other people may find helpful.</p>
